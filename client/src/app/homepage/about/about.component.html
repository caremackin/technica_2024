        <h2>About imPACTful</h2>
        <p>Welcome to imPACTful, where we Promote Adolescentsâ€™ Comprehension of Text by assisting teachers in quickly and efficiently developing quality lessons using AI technology to shorten lesson development timelines while increasing lesson quality. 

            Problem-Solving:  When creating a quality lesson that relies on literacy or text-based content, teachers frequently spend extra time searching for media and resources that appropriately correlate to the lesson they are trying to construct.  
            
            ImPACTful is a project designed to assist teachers in quickly and efficiently generating appropriate media and resources necessary to accompany lessons to ensure student comprehension of the text and overall lesson.
